## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tennis-score-sharer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. In another terminal, start the Netlify dev server for functions:
```bash
npx netlify dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3030`

### Development Ports

## How to Use

### For Match Administrators (Score Recorders)

1. **Start a New Match**
   - Go to the home page and click "Start New Match"
   - Configure match settings (player names, scoring system, format)
   - Click "Start Match" to begin scoring

2. **Score the Match**
   - Use the + and - buttons to add/remove points
   - Use "Make Server" to change who's serving
   - The system automatically handles deuce, advantage, and game/set progression

3. **Share the Match**
   - Copy the shareable URL that appears at the top
   - Send it to friends and family to let them follow along

4. **Return to Match**
   - If you close the window or refresh, you can return to your match
   - Use the "Return to Match" option on the home page
   - Enter your match ID and admin token to continue scoring
   - The match ID is displayed in the scoring interface header

### For Match Viewers

1. **Follow a Match**
   - Click the shared URL from the match administrator
   - View the live scoreboard (read-only)
   - See real-time updates every 2 seconds

## Real-time Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Polling Strategy**: 2-second intervals for real-time updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with server
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when network issues occur
- **Caching**: Client-side caching to reduce API calls

### Future Enhancements
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Server-Sent Events**: Alternative real-time solution
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile notifications for score updates
- **Offline Support**: Service workers for offline functionality

## Tennis Scoring Rules Supported

### Scoring Systems
- **Ad Scoring**: Players must win by 2 points after deuce
- **No-Ad Scoring**: At deuce, next point wins the game

### Match Formats
- **Single Set**: One set only
- **Best of 3**: First to win 2 sets
- **Best of 5**: First to win 3 sets

### Final Set Tiebreak

- **7-Point**: Final set decided by first to 7 points (win by 2)
- **10-Point**: Final set decided by first to 10 points (win by 2)
- **Common Use**: Used in recreational tennis and some tournament formats

### Set Duration
- **4 Games**: Short sets (recreational)
- **6 Games**: Standard tennis
- **8 Games**: Pro-set (single set to 8 games)

### Tie Break Rules
- **No Tie Break**: Continue until 2-game lead

## API Endpoints

### Core Match Operations
- `POST /.netlify/functions/create-match` - Create a new match with configuration
- `GET /.netlify/functions/get-match` - Retrieve match data by ID
- `PUT /.netlify/functions/update-match` - Update match score and state

### Data Flow
1. **Match Creation**: User configures match â†’ API creates match â†’ Returns match ID and admin token
2. **Real-time Scoring**: Admin updates score â†’ API validates â†’ Database updated â†’ Viewers poll for updates
3. **Match Viewing**: Public URL accessed â†’ API retrieves match â†’ Real-time scoreboard displayed
4. **Match Return**: Admin returns to match â†’ URL contains match ID â†’ API loads match configuration

### Authentication
- **Admin Access**: Requires admin token for score updates
- **Public Access**: Read-only access for match viewers
- **Token Generation**: Unique admin tokens created per match
- **URL Persistence**: Match ID embedded in scoring URL for easy return

## Development
