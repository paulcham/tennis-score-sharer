## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Netlify CLI (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tennis-score-sharer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env-template.txt .env.local
```
Edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials (see Environment Setup below).

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
# or use the new dev commands:
npm run dev
npm run dev:start
```

5. In another terminal, start the Netlify dev server for functions:
```bash
npx netlify dev
```

### Development Commands

The following npm scripts are available for development:

- `npm start` - Start the React development server (port 3030)
- `npm run dev` - Start the full development environment (Netlify dev server on port 8898)
- `npm run dev:start` - Start the full development environment
- `npm run dev:stop` - Stop the development server
- `npm run dev:restart` - Restart the development server (stop + start)
- `npm run dev:restart:cross` - Cross-platform restart (works on Windows/macOS/Linux)
- `npm run frontend` - Start only the React frontend (port 3030)
- `npm run backend` - Start only the Netlify dev server (port 8898)

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8898` when using the dev commands, but the browser will only open `http://localhost:3030` automatically.

### Development Ports

- **React App (standalone)**: `http://localhost:3030` (changed from 3000) - Browser opens here automatically
- **Full Dev Environment**: `http://localhost:8898` (Netlify dev server with React app + functions)
- **Netlify Functions**: Available via `http://localhost:8898/.netlify/functions/*`

### Environment Setup

The application requires Supabase configuration for database functionality. Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Client-side)
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Supabase Configuration (Server-side for Netlify Functions)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

**To get these values:**
1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings â†’ API in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
4. For the service role key, use the `service_role` key (keep this secret!)

These ports are configured to prevent conflicts with other local applications.

## How to Use

### For Match Administrators (Score Recorders)

1. **Start a New Match**
   - Go to the home page and click "Start New Match"
   - Configure match settings (player names, scoring system, format)
   - Click "Start Match" to begin scoring

2. **Score the Match**
   - Use the + and - buttons to add/remove points
   - Use "Make Server" to change who's serving
   - The system automatically handles deuce, advantage, and game/set progression

3. **Share the Match**
   - Copy the shareable URL that appears at the top
   - Click the QR code icon to generate a QR code for easy mobile sharing
   - Send the URL or QR code to friends and family to let them follow along

4. **Return to Match**
   - If you close the window or refresh, you can return to your match
   - Use the "Return to Match" option on the home page
   - Enter your match ID and admin token to continue scoring
   - The match ID is displayed in the scoring interface header

### For Match Viewers

1. **Follow a Match**
   - Click the shared URL from the match administrator
   - View the live scoreboard (read-only)
   - See real-time updates every 2 seconds

## Real-time Architecture

### Current Implementation
- **Polling Strategy**: 2-second intervals for real-time updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with server
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when network issues occur
- **Caching**: Client-side caching to reduce API calls
- **Clean Code**: Removed debug logs and optimized performance

### Future Enhancements

## API Endpoints

### Core Match Operations
- `POST /.netlify/functions/create-match` - Create a new match with configuration
- `GET /.netlify/functions/get-match` - Retrieve match data by ID
- `PUT /.netlify/functions/update-match` - Update match score and state

### Data Flow
1. **Match Creation**: User configures match â†’ API creates match â†’ Returns match ID and admin token
2. **Real-time Scoring**: Admin updates score â†’ API validates â†’ Database updated â†’ Viewers poll for updates
3. **Match Viewing**: Public URL accessed â†’ API retrieves match â†’ Real-time scoreboard displayed
4. **Match Return**: Admin returns to match â†’ URL contains match ID â†’ API loads match configuration

### Authentication
- **Admin Access**: Requires admin token for score updates
- **Public Access**: Read-only access for match viewers
- **Token Generation**: Unique admin tokens created per match
- **URL Persistence**: Match ID embedded in scoring URL for easy return
